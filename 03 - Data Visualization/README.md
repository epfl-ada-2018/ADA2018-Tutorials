# Data Visualization - ADA 2018 Tutorial

---

#### What do you find in this notebook ?

The purpose of the Notebook is to offer a **quick** overview on how to build maps with [`folium`](https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In details, we go through the basics of the `folium` API, then apply these methods to a simple visualization of the results of the 2016 US presidential election.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive documentation of `folium`, its features or its API, but can be useful in the context of Homework 2.
