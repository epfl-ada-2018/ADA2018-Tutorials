    "# Good Coding Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a small guide on *how-to-code*. Although it's quite succint, there are a couple of things you should know:\n",
    " * Remember that the *you* from two months ago does not reply to emails.\n",
    " * Everyone, from beginner to pro, might be able to learn something from this tutorial.\n",
    " * Don't try to be a perfectionist the first time around (there is no need to spend weeks going through documentation).\n",
    " * These are *good enough* practices to ease your code maintenance and collaboration. You'll have a whole career if you find out the *best* practices (if they even exist...).\n",
    " * Follow the KISS principle (Keep it simple, *s’ilvousplait*).\n",
    " * The goal of coding is not to code faster but to code for longer use.\n",
    " * Consistency is king. Even if your approach is not the best, by keeping it consistent people will be able to understand and deal with your code much more easily.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Coding Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially if you are a beginner, using text editors (or IDEs) may help you a lot in the process. Pycharm, for example, gives you easy acces to code predictions and methods' documentation:\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "![Pycharm](images/pycharm.png)\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "Aside from that, the way you structure your code should follow certain guidelines. PEP8 is the official standards for Python. In a nutshell, this standard suggests:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use either spaces or tabs to indent your code (but be consistent with your choice):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " def space_indented():\n",
    "       pass\n",
    " ```\n",
    " **Note:** Although using tabs is not the end of the world, mixing tabs and spaces might be, however.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Surround top-level functions and class definitions with two blank lines, while only leaving one line for other methods/functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # CODE ABOVE\n",
    " \n",
    " class MyClass:\n",
    "     \n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "         \n",
    " # CODE BELOW\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Imports should be on top, one per line and in increasing specificity order:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " import library\n",
    " import library as lb\n",
    " from library import module\n",
    " from library import module_one, module_two\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * String delimiters should not matter, unless you want to avoid manually escaping characters with '\\':\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " print('Teajay is cool.')\n",
    " print(\"Nuno is also cool.\")\n",
    " print(\"Teajay and Nuno's tutorial is super cool.\")\n",
    " print('Backslash in the middle doesn\\'t look good.')\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * White spaces are good when used properly (like after a punctuation mark) but should be avoided when unnecessary:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Do not inline *if*, *for* and *while*:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " if foo == 'blah':\n",
    "       do_blah_thing()\n",
    " else:\n",
    "       do_non_blah_thing()\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()\n",
    " else: do_non_blah_thing()\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Commenting should be used whenever necessary (but it's not always necessary):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " x = x + 1\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " x = x + 1 # Increment by one\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Naming should obey these simple patterns:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Variables should be named in lower case\n",
    " variable_name = None\n",
    " \n",
    " # Functions should be named like variables\n",
    " def function_name(): pass\n",
    " \n",
    " # Classes should be named in CamelCase\n",
    " class ClassName: pass\n",
    " \n",
    " # Constants should be name in all caps\n",
    " CONSTANT_NAME = None\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * You should stay away from global variables (and assign default parameter values instead):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " def inc(x, step = 1):\n",
    "       return x + step\n",
    "     \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " step = 1\n",
    " def inc(x):\n",
    "       return x + step\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * You should avoid using absolute file paths and use relative paths instead:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " with open('./files/info.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       print(file.read())\n",
    " \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " with open('/home/user/Documents/files/info.txt') as file:\n",
    "       print(file.read())\n",
    " ```\n",
    " * Note that \"./\" refers to current folder/directory, use \"../\" to select the parent direct. \n",
    " <br/><br/>\n",
    " \n",
    " ## 2. Python Tips\n",
    " \n",
    " * Collections library is your friend, while using dictionaries:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Without Collections\n",
    " todo_list = {}\n",
    " if 'ADA' not in todo_list:\n",
    "       todo_list['ADA'] = list([])\n",
    " todo_list['ADA'].append('Homework 2')\n",
    " \n",
    " # With Collections\n",
    " todo_list = collections.defaultdict(list)\n",
    " todo_list['ADA'].todo_list('Homework 2')\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Collections library is your friend, for counting multiple objects:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python \n",
    " # Without Collections\n",
    " counter = {}\n",
    " counter['apples'] = 0\n",
    " counter['oranges'] = 0\n",
    " counter['apples'] += 1\n",
    " counter['oranges'] += 1\n",
    " \n",
    "  # With Collections\n",
    " counter = collections.Counter()\n",
    " counter['apples'] += 1\n",
    " counter['oranges'] += 1\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Reading files should be done with the following construct:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Good practice\n",
    " with open('file', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       print(file.read())\n",
    "       \n",
    " # Bad practice\n",
    " file = open('file', 'r')\n",
    " try:\n",
    "       print(file.read())\n",
    " finally:\n",
    "       file.close()\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Note:** Using `open(...) as ...` automatically closes the file after the block finishes running.\n",
    " \n",
    " * You can use pickle to store complex objects in memory (saving time when repeating the same operations):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " import pickle\n",
    " \n",
    " def load_pickle(file_path):\n",
    "       with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:\n",
    "           return pickle.load(file)\n",
    " \n",
    " def save_pickle(result, file_path = 'pickle'):\n",
    "       with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:\n",
    "           pickle.dump(result, file_path)\n",
    " \n",
    " def very_complex_operation():\n",
    "       try:\n",
    "           return load_pickle('pickle')\n",
    "       except (FileNotFoundError, EOFError) as e:\n",
    "           # 30 minute long computation\n",
    "           save_pickle(result)\n",
    "           return result\n",
    " \n",
    " print(very_complex_operation())  # Takes ~30 minutes\n",
    " print(very_complex_operation())  # Takes a couple of seconds\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * String formatting is easy if you know how to do it:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # This will convert the integer to string automatically before printing.\n",
    " print(num_of_apples)\n",
    "\n",
    " # This however, will not. \n",
    " print(\"There are \" + num_of_apples + \" apples on the table.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " # You can convert the integers to strings manually, but it's a bad practice.\n",
    " print(\"There are \" + str(num_of apples) + \" apples on the table.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " # Instead, we recommend you to format strings using %\n",
    " print(\"There are %d apples on the table.\" % (num_off_apples))\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    " **Note:** Use %d for decimals/integers, %f for floats (alternatively %.**x**f to specify a precision of **x**), and %s for strings (or objects with string representations).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define configuration-related variables at the top of your modules or scripts. This is a data science class, so you are going to process lots of data by reusing the same code - and this will allow you to re-configure it easily:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " import pandas as pd\n",
    " \n",
    " DATA_PATH = './data/'\n",
    " DEFAULT_ENCODING = 'UTF8'\n",
    " DEFAULT_COMPRESSION = 'gzip'\n",
    " \n",
    " # CODE BELOW\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Also, you should avoid manually loading every single file you need to process: \n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Looping through every file in a directory\n",
    " from os import listdir\n",
    " \n",
    " DATA_PATH = './data/'\n",
    " \n",
    " def process_data(path = DATA_PATH):\n",
    "     for file in listdir(path):\n",
    "         do_something(path + file)\n",
    "         \n",
    " # Providing the target files through the command line\n",
    " from argparse import ArgumentParser\n",
    " \n",
    " parser = ArgumentParser()\n",
    " parser.add_argument(\"--filename\", help=\"Name of the file to process\", type = str)\n",
    " args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    " \n",
    " print(args.filename)\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Note:** An indepth guide can on command line parsing can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html).\n",
    " \n",
    " <br/><br/>\n",
    " \n",
    " ## 3. Code Organization\n",
    " \n",
    " This part definitely comes naturally with practice so here we simply give you simple pointers to get you started:\n",
    " \n",
    "* Every *.py* file should be solely comprised of functions and/or classes at its top level (and their necessary imports). Any executable code should go into the *main* function:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " import math\n",
    " \n",
    " def factorial(n):\n",
    "       return math.factorial(n)\n",
    " \n",
    " if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "       print(factorial(3))\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    "* Use docstring for documenting your code. More than allowing text editors and IDEs to show you this information afterwards, it will make your code more understandeable and maintainable:\n",

    " ```\n",
    " **Note:** Docstring help your IDE recognizing the type of an argument (in this example, Pycharm will recognize n is an int).\n",
    " \n",
    "* Keep differently purposed sections of your code in different *.py* files (and import them as you'd like):\n",
    " \n",

    " \n",
    "* Use top down design to decide on which modules to use (or parts of a single module):\n",
    " 1. Define your problem.\n",
    " 2. Define the necessary tasks (fetch data, preprocess, etc...) and enumerate them (1, 2, 3, ...). \n",
    " 3. Decompose each task into smaller subtasks and enumerate them again (1.1, 1.2, ...).\n",
    "      \n",
    " **Note:** You can also use this hierarchy in either file comments or file names (naming your files *1-fetch_data.py* or *2-preprocess_data.py* to keep them organized). \n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    " <br/><br/>\n",
    " \n",
    " ## 4. ADA Specific Tips\n",
    " \n",
    " * When working with larger amounts of data (especially for the project) test your code with small chunks of it:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " def dubious_analysis(df):\n",
    "       raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "     \n",
    " dubious_analysis(df.head(100))\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * You can easily pickle DataFrames with one-liners:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " df.to_pickle('path')\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * Use databases to keep persistent data (with a three-liner):\n",
    " \n",
    " ```python\n",
    " from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n",
    " engine = create_engine('connection string')\n",
    " df = pd.read_sql('events', con = engine)\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " * When you scale up and start considering more scalable tools (that you will hear about in a couple of weeks) you should always consider whether or not the volume of your data justifies your choice. Everything comes at a cost.\n",
    "\n",
    " <br/><br/>\n",
    " \n",
    "## 5. Modularity Examples!\n",
    " \n",
    " Last but definitely not least, examples! For those of you that read in-between the lines this might have been obvious but we still want to make sure everyone remembers these. To simplify your code - and your teammates' life when reading it - we will go over a simple code example that you can draw from in the near future.\n",
    " \n",
    " Imagine a situation where you have several airports filghts' departure data for the month of January. In this instance, you want to create an application that can show you a single airport's data for a given day, sorted by the departure time (much like you see on an actual airport's tableau). The data's columns are very simple: \n",
    " \n",
    "     airport_id, flight_id, dest_id, day, hour\n",
    " \n",
    " Your first approach might be something like this:\n",

With or without the use of `classes`, off-loading auxiliary functions to external scripts is always a good idea.\n",

    " We suspect a person from the Data Analsys Lab is attempting to sell some of our secrets to a foreign company. After analysing encrypted messages coming from our lab, we really don't think this person put too much effort into hidding its tracks but we still can't decypher their traffic. Inside the folder `data` you'll find a *pickle* with our preliminary analysis.\n",

    " ### 6.1. Finding Patterns\n",
    " \n",
    " Inside the pickled object you'll find a dictionary with two fields: *alphabet* (the alphabet used in the encrypted language); and *pairs* (with pairs of co-occurring characters accross several messages). By seeing how many times pairs of characters appear in the data, we think you will be able to give us interesting insights.\n",

    " ### 6.2. Organizing information\n",
    " \n",
    " There are a lot of directions we can go with the characters' co-occurrence counts. Although you can do complex analysis on it, we think that organizing the counts you got into a 2D matrix could showcase interesting aspects of your results. (*Note:* in this matrix you may want to sort each axis according to the alphabet's order - or numerical order, if you convert each character to its index)\n",
